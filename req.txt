The project must include the following:
• The project web site must have at least 5 pages. Each page must have a distinct purpose.
• Each page must have a header that is consistent between pages. The header should
clearly identify the purpose of the site. For example, if the site has a banner “Declawed”,
it should have a smaller tagline reading, “A competition-free space for women to relate to
one another” or “The ins and outs of keeping a large predator around little children” or
“Low cost services for the family pet”.
• Each page must have a footer that includes the author’s name, copyright, the date the
page was last modified, and anything else pertinent to your site. The footers must be
consistent between pages.
• Each page must have a navigation bar that allows the user to directly go to each
page. The navigation bar must be consistent between pages.
• Each page must have at least one paragraph of meaningful text or a table.
• All pages must use the same CSS file, but you can have other CSS files that are only used
on certain pages, as long as the overall user experience is consistent between pages.
• At least one page has to have an embedded style in the head element.
• The website must include at least 3 figures (containing images) in addition to any images
contained in the header, footer or navigation bar of the page.
• All images must have meaningful alt text for blind users.
• At least one of the pages must contain a table with at least two columns and at least two
rows. The table must contain column headings.
• Each page should include section, article, and header semantic elements.
